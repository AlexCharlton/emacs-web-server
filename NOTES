* Notes
* Tasks [1/4]
** DONE Handle POST requests
1. read standard for POST data
2. parse multi-line headers with boundaries

For now keep this all incremental and in ews-filter.

** TODO Makefile
- byte-compile
- package
- test
- benchmark

** TODO Lazy header processing
Use lazy sequence functions for header a-list to avoid parsing all
headers.  For regexp matchers should stop when matched header is
encountered (often the first one when :GET), For function matchers
provide lazy version of assoc.

** TODO use gnutls for https
I think this should work.
